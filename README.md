# project-ACDC

## static / dynamic website ##

*This project is part of my one year study as a software engineer at the IMT ATLANTIQUE (France, Nantes).*

The goal of this project is to easily make new entries on a website built on top of the jekyll solution (more information on https://jekyllrb.com).
